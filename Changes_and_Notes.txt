NEW FEATURES:
- Manually typing in the URL will redirect users to the correct page. For example,
  typing in http://localhost:8080/blog will redirect you to the blog page (it should
  just text saying "Homepage of Blog Page"). The same thing works for the resources
  page except you would type http://localhost:8080/resources.
